# Thermionically-Emitted-Electron-Beam-from-Thoriated-Tungsten
A 1st year Summer group project for the undergraduate physics course at Imperial College London.
- Constructed an electron beam from the thermionic emission of a thoriated tungsten cathode, inside a customized vacuum chamber.  
- Engineered and Manufactured a faraday cup to detect the electron beam's current and plotted it against the cathode's temperature to investigate the Richardson's law.
- Estimated the Boltzmann constant to within the correct order of magnitude by fitting curves to the result graph using Python NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
